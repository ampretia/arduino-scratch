# Arduino Scratch

**A physical computing experiment using Scratch and Grove Modules**

## Introduction

A set of Grove modules connected to an Arduino board; controlled directly by the latest in-browser Scratch. Aims are to be able to let kids extend there knowledge out from using Scratch just on screen to be able to interact with the physcial world.

Worth mentioning that the hardware has been built from scrap and surplus parts!

## Getting Started 

- If you've already got the hardware good to go  [Using Arduino-Scratch](./docs/scratch/00-gettingstarted.md)
- 


## Software Stack

There are other ways of doing this, some commercial some open versions; a common feature of many of them is they use a 'proxy' to communicate between Scratch (or other visual editor) and the Arduino. Here the Scratch extension is using the very latest Web-Serial support - so no proxy required.

### Scratch Extension

Based on the great work done by Dale and his [example extension](https://github.com/dalelane/scratch-extension-development)
